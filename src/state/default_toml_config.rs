#  This file allows you to configure mn.  Specifically, you can configure any
#  option that you could otherwise set with a command-line flag.  For example,
#  if you set `force = true` in the `[rm]` section below, then running `mn rm`
#  will never prompt you for confirmationâ€”it will always act as though you had
#  passed the `--force` flag to the `rm` command.


# An array of default mnemonics to use with every st commands act only on the
# first mnemonic in the array.
#     ## Example:
#     mnemonics = ["notes"] 
#     # Running `mn` will now display the notes mnemonic
mnemonics = []

# The directory in which to store your mnemonics.
# NOTE: if you change this value after creating mnemonics, you will need to
# copy your mnemonics from the old directory.
#     ## Example:
#     directory = "~/..mnemonics"
directory = "SET_DYNAMICALLY_BASED_ON_ENV_VARS"


# The following variables apply to the `mn add` command
[add]
# Create a blank mnemonic without opening it for # editing.
blank = false

# The editor used to create new mnemonics
# NOTE: this may be different than the editor used to edit existing mnemonics
editor = "SET_DYNAMICALLY_BASED_ON_ENV_VARS" 


# The following variables apply to the `mn edit` command
[edit]
# The editor used to edit existing mnemonics
# NOTE: this may be different than the editor used to create new mnemonics
editor = "SET_DYNAMICALLY_BASED_ON_ENV_VARS"

# Remove a mnemonic without prompting for confirmation

# Print all mnemonics as plaintext (e.g., without syntax highlighting)
